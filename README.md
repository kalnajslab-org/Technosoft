# Technosoft

This library serves as a base class that implements an Arduino serial interface to [Technosoft motion controllers](https://technosoftmotion.com/en/intelligent-drives/). The interface implements the ability to read drive registers, update drive parameters, and call user-implemented functions written in Technosoft Motion Language (TML) on the controllers. All of this is in accordance with the [TML documentation](https://technosoftmotion.com/en/catalogs-brochures/).
